# TrimUI Smart Pro PPSSPP Configs

This repo serves as a collection of PPSSPP game configs for the TrimUI Smart Pro, allowing for optimal performance in harder to run games, as well as control schemes that make use of the right analog stick in games such as *Coded Arms*, *Me & My Katamari* etc.

Please note that some games, such as *God of War: Chains of Olympus* and *OutRun 2006* may require the Vulkan backend and/or FPS cheats to be used for best performance.

To install, copy the configurations from the `configs/` dir into `/mnt/SDCARD/Emus/PSP/PPSSPP_1.17.1/.config/ppsspp/PSP/SYSTEM/` on your TrimUI Smart Pro, assuming you have CrossMix-OS installed.
