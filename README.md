# TrimUI Smart Pro PPSSPP Configs

This repo serves as a collection of PPSSPP game configs for the TrimUI Smart Pro, allowing for optimal performance in harder to run games, as well as control schemes that make use of the right analog stick in games such as *Coded Arms*, *Me & My Katamari* etc.

Please note that some games may require the Vulkan backend and/or FPS cheats to be used for best performance. For more information, please read the README inside the `configs/` directory of this repo. 

To install, copy the configurations from the `configs/` dir into `/mnt/SDCARD/Emus/PSP/PPSSPP_1.17.1/.config/ppsspp/PSP/SYSTEM/` on your TrimUI Smart Pro, assuming you have CrossMix-OS installed.
