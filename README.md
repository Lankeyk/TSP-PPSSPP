# TrimUI Smart Pro PPSSPP Configs

This repo serves as a collection of PPSSPP game configs for the TrimUI Smart Pro, allowing for optimal performance in harder to run games, as well as control schemes that make use of the right analog stick in games such as *Coded Arms*, *Me & My Katamari* etc.

Please note that some games, such as *God of War: Chains of Olympus* may require the Vulkan backend to be used for best performance.
